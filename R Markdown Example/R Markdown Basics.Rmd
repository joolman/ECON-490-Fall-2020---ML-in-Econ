# R Markdown Basics
********************************************************************
Here are some fundamentals to writing in R Markdown.

## Writing text
********************************************************************
This is how to write text in R Markdown.
Notice writing on the next line stays in the same paragraph.

This is how you start a new paragraph.
Wrap your words in a \* to get *italics*.
Using two \*s will produce a **boldface**.

There are other things we can do, like making lists.

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
   b. Notice how we had to align within the R Markdown code
      - You can choose whether you use numbers or letters, but R Markdown chooses the symbols for you :(

This is how we reference inline code like `R`'s base function `plot`, which is not as pretty as `ggplot2`'s function `ggplot`.

To write math, we can use some limited `latex` features.
Like if we wanted to show a regression formula inline:
$y_i = \alpha + x_i \beta + \epsilon_i$.
Alternatively, f we have important math like the geometric series identity, we can make it stand out:
$$
2^2 = 4\\
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n & = a \left( \frac{1}{1-r} \right)\\
  & = \frac{a}{1-r} \\
  & = \text{for } |r| < 1
\end{align*}
$$

### Hyperlinks

If we want to link sections, we do this [Section 1].
Or if we need to link a website, we do this while making sure to include https:
A really useful [resource](https:/www.bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown).


This is how include images in our markdown:

## Code chunks
********************************************************************
Here is the basics to writing code chunks.

```{r hello}
print('Hello world!')
```

Things we can specify in our code chunks:

- `include` - whether to be included in the document
- `echo` - display the code
- `results` - display the output of the code
- `messages` - display messages from functions (if they have them)
- `warnings` - display


# An Example Assignment
********************************************************************
We must do the following:

1. Load ggplot2
2. load in gampmind_2007
3. Produce a correlation matrix
4. obtain mean and standard deviation of America's GDPc
5. Summary stats of life expectancy for countries with GDPc less than $10,000
6. Replicate plot from the last lecture

## Load in ggplot2 and gampinder_2007
********************************************************************
```{r preliminary setup, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
gm = read.csv('C:/Users/johnj/Documents/Data/Applied ML ECON490/lecture data/gapminder_2007.csv')
```

Done, but I am not going to show you! Muwahahahahaha

## Produce Three Sets of Statistics
********************************************************************
Here is a correlation matrix of GDP per capita, life expectancy, and population.
```{r cor mat, echo = FALSE}
cor(gm[, c('gdpPercap', 'lifeExp', 'pop')])
```

Here is the mean and standard deviation of the America's GDP per capita.
```{r m sd Americas}
americas = gm[gm$continent == 'Americas', ]
m = mean(americas$gdpPercap)
m = round(m, 2)
s = round(sd(gm[gm$continent == 'Americas', 'gdpPercap']), 2)
print(paste0("Americas' mean: ", m))
print(paste("Americas' standard deviation: ", s))
```

And finally here are the summary statistics of life expectancy for countries with less than $10,000 GDP per capita.
```{r poor stats}
summary(gm[gm$gdpPercap < 10000, 'lifeExp'])
```

## Replicate Last Lectures Plot
********************************************************************
Here is the plot that we have already made, but you are making us make again.
```{r eda, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.5}
ggplot(gm, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_size_continuous(guide = 'none') +
  scale_color_discrete(name = 'Continent') +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = 'GDP per Capita (USD)', y = 'Life Expectancy (years)', title = 'GDPc vs. Life Expectancy') +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
```

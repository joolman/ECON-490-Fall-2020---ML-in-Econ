# ECON 490 Fall 2020 - ML in Econ

This repository contains the materials I created from my course Applied Machine Learning in Economics (UIUC ECON 490 Fall 2020).
The techniques were taught in R.
The subsequent Spring 2021 class was taught in Python.

**Note:** solutions to assignments and workshops are deliberately not included.
Additionally, data used in this class are not provided. However, lecture 3 describes how to construct the data used throughout the lectures, and HW 1 describes how to construct the data used in the homework assignments.
